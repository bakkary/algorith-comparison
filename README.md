# Linked List vs Array Performance Comparison

This project compares the speed and memory usage of linked lists vs arrays and heaps vs binary trees in Python. It aims to provide insights into the performance characteristics of these four data structures for various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To compare the performance of arrays and linked lists, run the following command:

```bash
python src/array_vs_linkedlist.py
```

to compare the performance of heaps and binary trees, run the following command:

```bash
python src/heap_vs_binary_tree.py
```


## Running Tests

To ensure that the implementations behave as expected, run the unit tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
